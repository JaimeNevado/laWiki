# Cloudinary: Image Management and Optimization

## Overview
Cloudinary is a cloud-based service designed to manage, optimize, and deliver images and videos. It provides powerful tools for developers to upload, transform, optimize, and serve media files efficiently across websites and applications. 

## Key Features

1. **Image Upload and Storage**:  
   Cloudinary allows you to upload images through APIs, SDKs, or a simple drag-and-drop interface. Once uploaded, the files are stored securely in the cloud with easy access.

2. **Image Transformations**:  
   Cloudinary supports a wide range of real-time transformations including:
   - Resizing, cropping, and scaling.
   - Applying filters (grayscale, sepia, etc.).
   - Adding overlays, text, and watermarks.
   - Rotating, flipping, or mirroring images.
   - Automatic format conversion (JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF).

3. **Optimization**:  
   Automatically optimizes images for web performance, delivering the smallest possible file size while maintaining quality. Features include:
   - Adaptive formats (WebP, AVIF).
        - AVIF: Best for websites or apps where reducing bandwidth usage is crucial, such as image-heavy e-commerce websites, photography portfolios, or sites with a global audience. Itâ€™s also great for high-quality visuals and HDR content.

        - **WebP**: A great all-around option that balances performance, quality, and compression efficiency. It's more reliable for broader compatibility across devices and browsers today, making it suitable for most general-purpose websites
   - Lossless and lossy compression.
   - Lazy loading.

4. **Responsive Images**:  
   Generate multiple versions of an image for different screen sizes and devices using the `srcset` attribute. This ensures fast loading across mobile, desktop, and high-DPI displays.

5. **CDN Delivery**:  
   Cloudinary integrates with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve media files globally, ensuring low-latency and fast image delivery worldwide.

6. **Advanced Search & Tagging**:  
   Cloudinary offers AI-based automatic tagging and searching for images, allowing easy organization and retrieval of media files.

7. **Video Support**:  
   In addition to images, Cloudinary handles video uploads, transcoding, transformations, and delivery.

    api_secret='your_api_secret',
    secure=True
)

# Upload endpoint for Cloudinary
@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload_image(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        # Upload the file to Cloudinary
        result = cloudinary.uploader.upload(file.file, folder="fastapi_uploads")
        
        # Return the secure URL of the uploaded image
        return {"url": result["secure_url"]}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Image upload failed: {str(e)}")
